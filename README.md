This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## To add a new item to PM2:
1. Go to the directory where you want to start the server.
2. use the pm2 serve command, specifying the folder and the port: pm2 serve ./demos/mission-crm 3002 --spa --name "mission-crm"

# pm2 serve ./demos/mission-crm 3002 --spa --name "mission-crm"
# And to add to the server dashboard, you need to include the specific html page in the URL: /crm_review.html

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
